[Microsoft header-only implementation of Guidelines Support Library](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL)
The Guidelines Support Library (GSL) contains functions and types that are
suggested for use by the C++ Core Guidelines maintained by the Standard C++ Foundation.
This repo contains Microsoft's implementation of GSL.

The entire implementation is provided inline in the headers under the gsl directory.
The implementation generally assumes a platform that implements C++14 support.
